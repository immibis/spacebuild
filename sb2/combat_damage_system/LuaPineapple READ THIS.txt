I'm sorry for this LPine, but I've temporarily revocked your access to the CDS 2 SVN.
You can still do updates to this SVN if you want and I'll check them out when you are done and give credit in the new CDS for any of the updates
you put into here I should use.

You're a great coder, but I'm trying to resolve some of the conflicts that are currently going on.

That's why I put the other txt file in here to also let people know about this and CDS 2.

If you don't want to do any coding anymore (for CDS or anything else I'm working) I won't blame you, but at the moment this is just the best thing to do.


Read it a long time ago, no idea why I'm keeping this file here, I'm not even sure who uploaded it in the first place.
But seeing that no one else seems to be doing anything with CDS I'm taking it over as a unilateral dictatorship. Obay or die.
And considering CDS 2 is a mere dream I think I won't bother waiting for it to make some new shit. (Like some REAL weapons.)
