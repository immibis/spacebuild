Before any of you think about uploading this to Garrysmod.org, stop!
If I find that anyone besides myself, has uploaded this addon to garrysmod.org, dont expect it to stay there very long.

I will upload the addon to garrysmod.org when I reach an important stage in developement, or made a significant change to the addon.
