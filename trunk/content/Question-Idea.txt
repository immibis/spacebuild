Is there a way to make a non-sperical habitat? Such as a spacestation, asteroid, etc...? It could probaby be made out of alot of spherical logic_cases, but that qould be highly inefficent. 
May I suggest adding a new entity to the gamemode for mappers to use?
Perhaps something like func_habitat, so you can make a trigger bush into a custom-shaped habitat? Perhaps this entity has a key saying a logic_case it's reference to that defines the area's parameters? It would be INCREDIBLY helpful as far as mapping is concerned. It would allow for huge improvements in the way I could map...
Also, are the O2, CO2, N, and H values relative, or realistic? Like for an Earth planet, should each be 25, or should it be more realistic with an Oxygen of 21, a Nitrogen of 77, and a 1 in N, and a 1 in H?

PS: PLEASE REPLY!

Non-Spherical:

	Well a brush based environment will be added to the gamemode soon, you should be able to form that into about any shape you want!

	I'll put more info in here once it's ready for some testing.

Values:

	Well I've made it so that everything about 5% O2 is habitable. This means that you can use both, realistic and relative.
	I think realistic might be the best to use though, but that's just my preference.

	Once more testing is done (public beta) then I'll be able to tweak everything to, because atm I don't really have that much of an idea how long
	a planet of a certain size can hold out with a certain percentage of O2.
